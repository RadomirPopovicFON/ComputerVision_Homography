# ComputerVision_Homography
Homography estimator from Computer Vision course

*Repository will be updated in the following period with more elaborated computations*

Tasks are the following: 
- Given some low derivative image, transform it via regular affine transformation.
- On the two images, match corner points given via Harris detector.
- Based on matched points, assess whether the matched points are correct. (https://github.com/RadomirPopovicFON/ComputerVision_Homography/blob/master/output_16.jpg)
- Compute Homography matrix.
