# ComputerVision_Homography
Homography estimator from Computer Vision course

Tasks are the following: 
- Given some low derivative image, transform it via regular affine transformation.
- On the two images, match corner points given via Harris detector.
- Based on matched points, assess whether are points are correct. [Check here for results!](https://github.com/RadomirPopovicFON/ComputerVision_Homography/output.jpg)
- Compute Homography matrix.
